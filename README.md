# Task Management API

### Description:
    Develop a task management API facilitating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. Each task should encompass essential attributes such as a title, description, due date, and status (e.g., pending, In Progress, completed).

### Requirements:
    User Authentication:
        - Incorporate user authentication to ensure only authorized users can access and modify their tasks.
        - Grant admin users full access to all tasks.

    Task Operations:
        - Establish an API endpoint for adding new tasks.
        - Create an API endpoint to retrieve a list of tasks for a specific user (Admin users can access all tasks).
        - Implement features to update task details and mark tasks as completed or delete them.
